# Task-7_Elevate_Labs
This project demonstrates setting up Netdata in Docker to monitor system and application performance in real time. It provides insights into CPU, memory, disk, network, and container metrics through an interactive dashboard. The outcome is a lightweight monitoring solution to track resource usage, detect anomalies, and ensure application health.
